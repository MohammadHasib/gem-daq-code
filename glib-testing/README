#Instructions to compile and run the program

#ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Code requires two environment variables to be set:
One called uHALROOT, Set it to uHAL installation directory
By default uHAL get installed in /opt/cactus directory

export uHALROOT=/opt/cactus

The second is to make the code run more smoothly out of the box
and is called GLIBTEST
Set it to the root working directory of the package you checked
out from git.

#COMPILING THE PROGRAM
From the source directory just execute compile.sh file
./compile.sh

This will compile and build program and the all the executables
will go to the bin directory.

[VERY VERY IMPORTANT]
Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable as given by the output of above script 

#RUNNING THE PROGRAM 
Executable should be run from the directory where "connection" and
"address" xml files are present

In the default case it is in source directory itself, so the executable
can be run as follows:
./bin/sturdy 

#OUTPUTS
Expected output from the "sturdy" sample program
=======================================
system_REG_1 = 117
=======================================

"system" executable in the bin directory give the information about the 
sytem, board, and the firware version and date
"uTCA","GLIB","3.1.0 : 15/2/13"
