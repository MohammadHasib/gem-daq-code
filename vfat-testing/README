#Instructions to compile and run the program

#ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Code requires two environment variables to be set:
One called uHALROOT, Set it to uHAL installation directory
By default uHAL get installed in /opt/cactus directory

##for sh style shells
export uHALROOT=/opt/cactus
##for csh style shells
setenv uHALROOT /opt/cactus

The second is to make the code run more smoothly out of the box
and is called GLIBTEST
Set it to the root working directory of the package you checked
out from git.

#COMPILING THE PROGRAM
From the source directory just execute compile.sh file
./compile.sh

This will compile and build program and the all the executables will go to the bin directory.

[VERY VERY IMPORTANT]
set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable as given by the output of above script 

#RUNNING THE PROGRAM 
##N.B. this program depends on having built ../glib-testing
The executable can be run as follows (if PATH is set to include
$GLIBTEST/vfat-testing/bin):
vfattest
othwise, specify the relative path:
./bin/vfattest

##if you run into a problem with the connection, try changing
data/myconnections.xml
Latest firmware with GLIB to Optical link uses 192.168.0.115
instead of 129.168.0.175
